Overview
The program is a simple command-line calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It ensures that inputs are valid and handles errors gracefully.

Code Structure
Function Definition:

The entire calculator functionality is encapsulated in a function named calculator().
Welcome Message:

A greeting message is printed to inform users that they are about to use the calculator.
User Input for Numbers:

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
It uses float(input(...)) to read and convert the input into floating-point numbers, allowing for decimal values.
A try block is used to handle invalid inputs:
If the user enters a non-numeric value, a ValueError is raised, and an error message is displayed. The function exits early with return.
Operation Selection Menu:

The program presents a list of available operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with corresponding numbers (1-4).
User Input for Operation:

The user is prompted to enter their choice of operation, which is stored in the variable operation.
Conditional Logic for Operations:

The program uses a series of if, elif, and else statements to determine which operation to perform based on the user's choice:
Addition: If the user selects '1', it calculates the sum of the two numbers and prints the result.
Subtraction: If '2' is selected, it computes the difference and displays it.
Multiplication: If '3' is selected, it multiplies the two numbers and shows the result.
Division: If '4' is chosen:
The program checks if the second number (num2) is not zero to avoid division by zero.
If valid, it performs the division and prints the result; otherwise, it displays an error message.
Invalid Operation Handling:

If the input for the operation does not match any valid option (1-4), the program informs the user that their selection is invalid.
Entry Point:

The code includes an entry point check (if __name__ == "__main__":), which ensures that the calculator function is executed only when the script is run directly, not when imported as a module.
Summary of Functionality
User Interaction: The program interacts with the user through prompts and messages, guiding them through entering numbers and selecting operations.
Error Handling: It robustly handles invalid inputs and division by zero, improving user experience and preventing crashes.
Clear Output: Results are clearly presented to the user, making the program easy to use.
Conclusion
This calculator program is a straightforward yet effective demonstration of basic programming concepts in Python, including functions, user input handling, conditional logic, and error management. It serves as a good starting point for understanding how to build interactive command-line applications.
